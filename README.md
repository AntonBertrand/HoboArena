Hobo Arena is a text-based roleplaying game with GUI inspired by the browser game HoboWars. You play as a hobo and can pick a fight against enemies for coins and experience, as well as the ability to scavenge the city for coins and items. Coins can be spent in the shop on healing apples and better weapons. You can submit your final score to the Highscores list in which other players will compete for the highest score.
